### SETUP EVENTS ###
 IW_setup.1.t: "New Leadership in the League of [IW_former_leader.GetName]"
 IW_setup.1.d1: "Threatened by foreign interlopers on all sides, the brave remaining coalition states of the Italic League will require strong leadership to ensure their very survival. The [IW_former_leader.GetAdjective] [IW_former_leader.Monarch.GetTitle] has proven himself to be unworthy of the title, and the member council has called [Root.Monarch.GetName] to assume the role of defender of Italy." # usurping Italian leader
 IW_setup.1.d2: "The annexation of [IW_former_leader.GetName] has left a void at the heart of the Italic League. With its former leader absorbed into the fold of a greater power, the League's future now hangs in the balance. To prevent its collapse and safeguard Italian autonomy, its member states have turned their gaze to [Root.GetName], urging it to take up the mantle of leadership. As the new head of the League, [Root.GetName] would wield significant influence—but at a cost.\n\nIn the grand halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], the ruling council debates the proposal. Accepting leadership would mean shouldering the burden of coordinating disparate interests and defending the League from external threats, all while managing the tensions that have plagued Italian politics for centuries. Turning it down, however, could shatter the fragile alliance, opening the door for outside powers to dominate the peninsula.\n\nThe question is clear: will [Root.GetName] rise to the occasion and unify the League under its guidance, or prioritize its own stability and turn down this daunting responsibility? The future of Italy rests on this decision." # Italian leader died
 IW_setup.1.d3: "The [IW_former_leader.GetAdjective] have failed, against all odds, to reassert Frankish dominance in Italy. Perhaps the memory of Charles d'Anjou would be better served with us at the head of this coalition." # usurping French leader
 IW_setup.1.d4: "The once-mighty Kingdom of [IW_former_leader.GetName], long the leader and symbol of the [GetFrenchLeagueName] League, has fallen into subjugation. The League, formed to protect [GetFrenchLeagueName] interests in the volatile Italian Peninsula, now finds itself adrift, its purpose threatened by the loss of its guiding power. Desperate to maintain its influence and cohesion, the remaining members turn to [Root.GetName], asking it to take up the mantle of leadership.\n\nWithin the courts of [Root.GetName], the gravity of this proposal sparks intense debate. To lead the [GetFrenchLeagueName] League is to inherit its noble mission of safeguarding [GetFrenchLeagueName] interests, but it is also to assume the burdens of diplomacy, military commitment, and the League's fractious politics. Accepting could elevate [Root.GetName] to a position of great prestige, but refusal might doom the League to fragmentation, leaving [GetFrenchLeagueName] ambitions in Italy at the mercy of rival powers.\n\nThe decision now rests in [Root.GetName]'s hands. Will it rise to lead the [GetFrenchLeagueName] League in these uncertain times, or prioritize its own stability and decline the role? The legacy of France and the future of the League depend on this choice." # French leader died The [IW_former_leader.Monarch.GetTitle] of [IW_former_leader.GetName] thought to rally his allies in reclaiming the legacy of Charles d'Anjou, but their hubris was their downfall. Will we be the ones to take up the mantle and continue the fight for Italy?
 IW_setup.1.d5: "Despite the many riches of Iberia at their disposal, [IW_former_leader.GetName] failed to secure the dynastic legacy of the Iberian houses in Italy. Perhaps we would do better..." # usurping Iberian leader
 IW_setup.1.d6: "The unexpected annexation of [IW_former_leader.GetName] has sent shockwaves across Iberia. Once the proud leader of the Iberian League—a coalition forged to protect Iberian interests in Italy—[IW_former_leader.GetName]'s downfall has left the League rudderless. With the specter of [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] influence rising in the Mediterranean and the Italic League growing bolder, the remaining members turn to [Root.GetName], urging it to take up the mantle of leadership.\n\nIn the capital of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], advisors debate the immense responsibility this position would bring. To accept would mean guiding the League's strategic direction and ensuring the safety of Iberian holdings in Italy. It offers unparalleled prestige and influence, but also significant risk—military entanglements, diplomatic complexities, and the burden of holding together a fractious coalition. Refusal, however, could weaken Iberia's position and leave the League vulnerable to collapse.\n\nAs the deliberations reach their climax, the weight of history presses heavily. Will [Root.GetName] rise to lead and strengthen Iberia's hand in Italy, or step aside, preserving its own stability at the cost of wider influence? The decision will shape not only the League's future but Iberia's destiny." # Iberian leader died
 IW_setup.1.d7: "The grand halls of the Imperial Diet resound with the echoes of debate and ceremony. The newly-crowned Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName], vested with the authority of the electors, now faces a pivotal moment. As the gathered princes and dignitaries confirm the Emperor's coronation, a matter of critical importance takes center stage—the confirmation of Imperial leadership over the Imperial League.\n\nFounded to safeguard the Empire's interests in the tumultuous lands of Italy, the League has grown into a vital instrument of Imperial policy. With Italy rife with ambition and foreign powers encroaching ever closer, the League's guidance is more crucial than ever. The assembled Diet looks to the Emperor, their expectations clear: to lead the League as a strong and unifying force, ensuring the Empire's influence over Italy remains undiminished.\n\nAs the Emperor accepts the mantle of leadership, a solemn oath is taken to preserve the unity of the Empire and to uphold its interests in Italy. The Diet applauds, and the Imperial banners are raised high above the chamber. The future of the Holy Roman Empire and its role in Italy now rests in the hands of its newly confirmed leader. Will the Emperor's guidance bring glory, or will the League falter under the weight of its ambitions?" # new HRE emperor
 IW_setup.1.d8: "The halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] echo with the urgent deliberations of diplomats and rulers. Formerly known as the Imperial League, the princes determined to pass leadership of what is now known as the 'German' League to one of their own, after the Holy Roman Empire fell under the control of a foreign power. Its mission—to safeguard German interests in Italy—remains vital, even as its leadership falters in the wake of the annexation of its former leader. Now, the League turns to [Root.GetName], urging it to step forward as their new guiding force.\n\nTo take up the mantle of leadership is a heavy responsibility. It offers [Root.GetName] the chance to cement its influence across the Italian Peninsula and wield significant diplomatic and military power. Yet, it also carries risks: the possibility of entanglement in costly wars, the challenge of maintaining unity among the fractious German states, and the weight of standing against foreign powers encroaching on Italian soil.\n\nThe decision is clear but not easy. Will [Root.GetName] rise to lead the German League, ensuring the preservation of German ambitions in Italy, or turn down the role, safeguarding its own stability at the expense of wider influence? The eyes of the League, and the future of German unity, are fixed on this moment."

 IW_setup.2.t: "The [GetFrenchLeagueName] League"
 IW_setup.2.d1: "The court of [Root.GetName] hums with purpose as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares to stake his rightful claim to the lands of Italy. For centuries, the legacy of Charles d'Anjou, the House of Valois' ancestor, has been tied to the Kingdom of [NAP.GetName]—a legacy unjustly wrested away and long overdue for restoration. Now, the time has come to fulfill this historic promise, to reclaim the lands that are the rightful inheritance of the French crown.\n\nRecognizing the scope of the campaign, [Root.GetName]'s most skilled diplomats are dispatched across Europe to form a coalition worthy of this grand endeavor. Letters sealed with the royal fleur-de-lis call upon neighboring states and mercenary leaders to join the Valois cause. Allies are promised their share of Italy's immense riches, while the glory of victory is offered as a beacon to rally the ambitious.\n\nThe vision is grand, and the resolve is unwavering. [Root.GetName] shall not be content to merely defend her borders; she will lead a charge that reshapes the destiny of Italy itself. As preparations mount, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s words echo in the halls of court: "By the grace of God and the rights of our House, we shall see the banners of Valois soar once more over the Italian hills.""
 IW_setup.2.d2: "The ambitions of [Root.GetName] stretch far beyond the windswept shores of the Channel. In the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName], voices whisper of the lost glories of the Angevin Empire and the Norman legacy in the Mediterranean. The Kingdom of [NAP.GetName], once governed by the House of Anjou, remains a tantalizing reminder of [Root.GetName]'s historic claims. Likewise, the Kingdom of Sicily, touched by the hands of Norman conquest, beckons as a jewel that rightfully belongs under [Root.GetName]'s banner.\n\nDetermined to restore [Root.GetName]'s influence on the continent and assert its claim to these storied lands, the crown now turns its attention to forging a grand coalition. Diplomatic envoys are dispatched to [BUR.GetName], [BRI.GetName], and the Holy Roman Empire, as well as smaller Italian states disillusioned with the fractious Italic League. [Root.GetName] promises shared spoils, secure trade routes, and protection against the overreach of Italy's rival factions.\n\nAs the league begins to take shape, [Root.Monarch.GetName] speaks boldly to his court: "By the blood of our forebears, the thrones of Naples and Sicily are ours to reclaim. Through steel and alliance, [Root.GetName] shall fulfill its destiny as a power across all realms." The banners of St. George are raised, and preparations for war begin. The Italian Peninsula braces for the arrival of a new claimant to its ancient crowns."
 IW_setup.2.d3: "Something something Lotharingia?"
 IW_setup.2.a: "We will reclaim the legacy of Anjou!"
 IW_setup.2a.tt: "Form the §Y[GetFrenchLeagueName] League§! with [Root.GetName] at its head. Nations across Europe will be called to join the cause.\n\nWe will have §Y12§! months to prepare before pressing our Angevin claims, which may lead to war with the §YItalic League§!..."

 IW_setup.3.a: "Finally, a worthy cause!"
 IW_setup.3.b: "[IW_french_league_leader.GetName]'s claims of grandeur mean little to us"

 IW_setup.4.t: "The Iberian League"
 IW_setup.4.d1: "The court of [Root.GetName] stirs with urgency as dark tidings arrive from the north. [IW_french_league_leader.GetName], emboldened by ambition and unchecked power, eyes the Kingdom of [NAP.GetName]—jewel of the [Root.GetAdjective] crown—as its next conquest. The reports of swelling [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] armies and the mobilization of Swiss mercenaries cannot be ignored. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], determined to protect his rightful holdings, convenes his most trusted advisors.\n\nThe decision is made: [Root.GetName] must not stand alone. Envoys are dispatched with haste, bearing the weight of [Root.GetName]'s plea to the great powers of Europe. Letters sealed with the royal crest urge them to join in a defensive League against the [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] juggernaut. Promises of mutual aid and assurances of shared prosperity flow freely, for the unity of Italy is the only bulwark against foreign domination.\n\nAs the diplomats set out, the court watches with bated breath. Will [Root.GetName]'s call be heeded, forging a united front to defend [NAP.GetName] and preserve the balance of power in Italy? Or will the peninsula's rivalries and ambitions leave [Root.GetName] to face the storm alone? The stakes could not be higher, for the flames of war draw ever closer."
 IW_setup.4.d2: "The flames of war engulf Italy once again as the [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] armies march southward with relentless ambition. In the halls of the [Root.GetAdjective] court, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] perceives an opportunity—not merely to protect his remaining holdings in Sicily, but to curb [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] influence in the Italian Peninsula altogether. It is time for Iberia to rise united. [Root.GetName], long a guardian of Mediterranean stability, calls upon its neighbors to form an Iberian League and intervene decisively in support of the Italic League.\n\nThe vision is bold: [Root.GetName] at the helm, forging ties with the powers of Europe to stand against [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] expansionism. Diplomats journey across Iberia, persuading reluctant allies with promises of trade benefits, shared spoils, and strengthened borders. Meanwhile, emissaries arrive in the Italic League, offering [Root.GetAdjective] aid in manpower and naval strength to tip the scales in their favor.\n\nIn forming the Iberian League, [Root.GetName] positions itself as a keystone in preserving the balance of power in Europe. The banners of Iberia, embroidered with the pride of a united purpose, will soon fly alongside those of Italy. The decision has been made—[Root.GetName] will not sit idly by as [IW_french_league_leader.GetName] seeks dominance. Unity, courage, and strategy must now guide the path forward, for the fates of Italy and Iberia are intertwined."
 IW_setup.4.d3: "The reverberations of the Italic League's triumph over [IW_french_league_leader.GetName] echo far beyond the Alps, unsettling the balance of power in the Mediterranean. In the court of [Root.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his advisors assess the shifting tides with wary eyes. The dominance of the Italic League threatens to overshadow [Root.GetAdjective] influence, both in Sicily and across the region. To preserve [Root.GetName]'s standing and protect its vital interests, a bold strategy takes form: the establishment of an Iberian League, with [Root.GetName] as its leader.\n\nEnvoys are sent to the courts of Europe bearing promises of strengthened trade, mutual defense, and a united Iberian front against foreign encroachment. The proposal is met with cautious enthusiasm; rivalries may divide the Iberian crowns, but the growing influence of the Italic League and the looming threat of [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] resurgence provide ample motivation for unity.\n\nWithin weeks, treaties are drafted, oaths sworn, and the Iberian League emerges as a new power bloc. [Root.GetName] stands proudly at its helm, determined to counter the sway of Italian diplomacy and secure its position as a leading force in the Mediterranean. Yet, the question remains: will this league endure the test of time, or will ambition and rivalry once again splinter the unity of Iberia?"

Imperial holdings are under siege, their fortresses threatened by the tide of foreign aggression. The cries for aid echo across the Holy Roman Empire, demanding swift and decisive action.\n\nIn response, the Emperor himself has convened an emergency council, declaring that the Empire cannot stand idle while its lands and allies are consumed by chaos. Diplomats are dispatched to every corner of the Empire, carrying a call to arms and a vision of unity—the creation of an Imperial League. This coalition will rally the Empire's resources to protect its southern territories and confront the invaders with unyielding strength.\n\nThe mission is clear: safeguard the Empire's legacy in Italy and repel the foreign aggressors. But the task is daunting, requiring the cooperation of rival princes, the mobilization of armies, and the will of a divided Empire. The banners of the League must be raised without hesitation, for the survival of the Empire's influence in Italy hangs by a thread. The Emperor's resolve is unshakable—failure is not an option."

The dream of reclaiming [NAP.GetName] and extending [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] dominance into Italy is no longer a distant vision—it is within reach.\n\nKnights clad in shining armor mount their steeds, their banners fluttering with the royal fleur-de-lis. Swiss mercenaries, battle-hardened and hungry for glory, stand shoulder to shoulder with [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] pikemen. The roads southward are cleared, supplies are gathered, and the finest tacticians prepare to guide the campaign.\n\n[IW_french_league_leader.Monarch.GetName], confident in his destiny, addresses his court. "The riches of Italy await us, and the world shall witness the might of [IW_french_league_leader.GetName]!" With these words, the drums of war echo, and the march on Italy begins.

 IW_setup.16.d: "Dark clouds gather over [NAP.GetName] as the shadow of [IW_french_league_leader.GetName] stretches ever closer. The rumors have crystallized into reality—[IW_french_league_leader.Monarch.GetName] has prepared his mighty host, intent on pressing his claim to the [NAP.GetAdjective] throne. The court is rife with unease; the streets hum with whispers of invasion. [NAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [NAP.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors stand divided, torn between pride and pragmatism.\n\nThe prospect of appealing to [IW_italian_league_leader.GetName] and the Italic League for protection stirs heated debate. Some argue that Italy must unite in the face of foreign aggression, for only a combined strength can deter the [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] war machine. Others fear the price of such alliances—[LAN.GetName]'s rivalry with [MLO.GetName], [VEN.GetName]'s ambitions, the meddling hands of Rome—could they trade one yoke for another?\n\nAs [NAP.GetName] deliberates, time grows short. Will the crown humble itself and reach out to its Italian neighbors, forging bonds to weather the storm? Or will they stand alone, resolved to face whatever comes? The fate of [NAP.GetName] hangs precariously, and the decisions made now will echo for generations."

Some see an opportunity to unite the Italian states against the northern invader and strengthen the League's influence. Others warn of the dangers: [NAP.GetName] could become a burden, dragging [IW_italian_league_leader.GetName] into a war it cannot afford.
