 IW_setup.2.t: "The [GetFrenchLeagueName] League"
 IW_setup.2.d1: "The court of [Root.GetName] hums with purpose as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares to stake his rightful claim to the lands of Italy. For centuries, the legacy of Charles d'Anjou, the House of Valois' ancestor, has been tied to the Kingdom of [NAP.GetName]—a legacy unjustly wrested away and long overdue for restoration. Now, the time has come to fulfill this historic promise, to reclaim the lands that are the rightful inheritance of the French crown.\n\nRecognizing the scope of the campaign, [Root.GetName]'s most skilled diplomats are dispatched across Europe to form a coalition worthy of this grand endeavor. Letters sealed with the royal fleur-de-lis call upon neighboring states and mercenary leaders to join the Valois cause. Allies are promised their share of Italy's immense riches, while the glory of victory is offered as a beacon to rally the ambitious.\n\nThe vision is grand, and the resolve is unwavering. [Root.GetName] shall not be content to merely defend her borders; she will lead a charge that reshapes the destiny of Italy itself. As preparations mount, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s words echo in the halls of court: "By the grace of God and the rights of our House, we shall see the banners of Valois soar once more over the Italian hills.""
 IW_setup.2.d2: "The ambitions of [Root.GetName] stretch far beyond the windswept shores of the Channel. In the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName], voices whisper of the lost glories of the Angevin Empire and the Norman legacy in the Mediterranean. The Kingdom of [NAP.GetName], once governed by the House of Anjou, remains a tantalizing reminder of [Root.GetName]'s historic claims. Likewise, the Kingdom of Sicily, touched by the hands of Norman conquest, beckons as a jewel that rightfully belongs under [Root.GetName]'s banner.\n\nDetermined to restore [Root.GetName]'s influence on the continent and assert its claim to these storied lands, the crown now turns its attention to forging a grand coalition. Diplomatic envoys are dispatched to [BUR.GetName], [BRI.GetName], and the Holy Roman Empire, as well as smaller Italian states disillusioned with the fractious Italic League. [Root.GetName] promises shared spoils, secure trade routes, and protection against the overreach of Italy's rival factions.\n\nAs the league begins to take shape, [Root.Monarch.GetName] speaks boldly to his court: "By the blood of our forebears, the thrones of Naples and Sicily are ours to reclaim. Through steel and alliance, [Root.GetName] shall fulfill its destiny as a power across all realms." The banners of St. George are raised, and preparations for war begin. The Italian Peninsula braces for the arrival of a new claimant to its ancient crowns."

 IW_setup.2.a: "We will reclaim the legacy of Anjou!"
 IW_setup.2a.tt: "Form the §Y[GetFrenchLeagueName] League§! with [Root.GetName] at its head. Nations across Europe will be called to join the cause.\n\nWe will have §Y12§! months to prepare before pressing our Angevin claims, which may lead to war with the §YItalic League§!..."

 IW_setup.3.b: "[IW_french_league_leader.GetName]'s claims of grandeur mean little to us"

 IW_setup.4.t: "The Iberian League"
 IW_setup.4.d1: "The court of [Root.GetName] stirs with urgency as dark tidings arrive from the north. [IW_french_league_leader.GetName], emboldened by ambition and unchecked power, eyes the Kingdom of [NAP.GetName]—jewel of the [Root.GetAdjective] crown—as its next conquest. The reports of swelling [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] armies and the mobilization of Swiss mercenaries cannot be ignored. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], determined to protect his rightful holdings, convenes his most trusted advisors.\n\nThe decision is made: [Root.GetName] must not stand alone. Envoys are dispatched with haste, bearing the weight of [Root.GetName]'s plea to the great powers of Europe. Letters sealed with the royal crest urge them to join in a defensive League against the [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] juggernaut. Promises of mutual aid and assurances of shared prosperity flow freely, for the unity of Italy is the only bulwark against foreign domination.\n\nAs the diplomats set out, the court watches with bated breath. Will [Root.GetName]'s call be heeded, forging a united front to defend [NAP.GetName] and preserve the balance of power in Italy? Or will the peninsula's rivalries and ambitions leave [Root.GetName] to face the storm alone? The stakes could not be higher, for the flames of war draw ever closer."
 IW_setup.4.d2: "The flames of war engulf Italy once again as the [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] armies march southward with relentless ambition. In the halls of the [Root.GetAdjective] court, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] perceives an opportunity—not merely to protect his remaining holdings in Sicily, but to curb [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] influence in the Italian Peninsula altogether. It is time for Iberia to rise united. [Root.GetName], long a guardian of Mediterranean stability, calls upon its neighbors to form an Iberian League and intervene decisively in support of the Italic League.\n\nThe vision is bold: [Root.GetName] at the helm, forging ties with the powers of Europe to stand against [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] expansionism. Diplomats journey across Iberia, persuading reluctant allies with promises of trade benefits, shared spoils, and strengthened borders. Meanwhile, emissaries arrive in the Italic League, offering [Root.GetAdjective] aid in manpower and naval strength to tip the scales in their favor.\n\nIn forming the Iberian League, [Root.GetName] positions itself as a keystone in preserving the balance of power in Europe. The banners of Iberia, embroidered with the pride of a united purpose, will soon fly alongside those of Italy. The decision has been made—[Root.GetName] will not sit idly by as [IW_french_league_leader.GetName] seeks dominance. Unity, courage, and strategy must now guide the path forward, for the fates of Italy and Iberia are intertwined."
 IW_setup.4.d3: "The reverberations of the Italic League's triumph over [IW_french_league_leader.GetName] echo far beyond the Alps, unsettling the balance of power in the Mediterranean. In the court of [Root.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his advisors assess the shifting tides with wary eyes. The dominance of the Italic League threatens to overshadow [Root.GetAdjective] influence, both in Sicily and across the region. To preserve [Root.GetName]'s standing and protect its vital interests, a bold strategy takes form: the establishment of an Iberian League, with [Root.GetName] as its leader.\n\nEnvoys are sent to the courts of Europe bearing promises of strengthened trade, mutual defense, and a united Iberian front against foreign encroachment. The proposal is met with cautious enthusiasm; rivalries may divide the Iberian crowns, but the growing influence of the Italic League and the looming threat of [IW_french_league_leader.GetAdjective] resurgence provide ample motivation for unity.\n\nWithin weeks, treaties are drafted, oaths sworn, and the Iberian League emerges as a new power bloc. [Root.GetName] stands proudly at its helm, determined to counter the sway of Italian diplomacy and secure its position as a leading force in the Mediterranean. Yet, the question remains: will this league endure the test of time, or will ambition and rivalry once again splinter the unity of Iberia?"
