 iw_events.1.t: "The Italian Wars"
 iw_events.1.d: "Despite Italy being subjected to many wars, they have always been between the numerous city states with limited intervention from outside powers. Although many of them thought this would remain the case, the rise of [italian_war_aggressor.GetName] has shaken the region. Many of the cities have now banded into numerous leagues, led by the powerful Italian countries, whilst others have joined these invaders in hopes of preserving their autonomy. Other sides such as the Holy Roman Emperor which resides in [emperor_country.Capital.GetName] are also keeping an eye out for any opportunities to rein in these princes that have been rebellious for far too long.\n\nWill the Italian states manage to resist these invaders together, or will they fall one by one?"
 iw_events.1.a: "Audaces fortuna iuvat!"
 
 iw_events.2.t: "Aiding [FRA.GetName]"
 iw_events.2.d: "Despite us not being directly involved in the politics of Italy, one of the league leaders that would benefit us, [FRA.GetName], has accumilated a large amount of enemies. Right now they stand alone, possibly encircled by jealous rivals that would want to see them dismantled. We can try to aid them either economically, or send some of our bravest troops and generals to lead them on, as men within the [ROOT.GetName] have accomplished victory after victory. However, this conflict is still not of our concern, and some suggest that we do not get involved at all."
 iw_events.1.a: "Let us send military aid."
 iw_events.1.b: "Our coffers are plenty, we can send them our gold."
 iw_events.1.c: "There is no need to be involved."
 iw_events.2.b.tt: "Transfer §R-[Root.money_to_transfer_info.GetValue]§! ¤ to §Y[FRA.GetName]§!."

 iw_events.1000.t: "Pressure in [florence_nation.GetName]"
 iw_events.1000.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has had a particular interest in [florence_nation.GetName] recently. Wishing to sway them within [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can choose two approaches. One of them is through diplomacy, as it is certain that the [florence_nation.Monarch.GetTitle] has not been in the best relations with the Pope and other Italian leagues. However, that runs at the risk of not having any way of aiding them in case their rivals decide to stop them. For that, many of our generals suggest a more violent yet effective approach, launching a coup within [florence_nation.Capital.GetName], forcing them on our side."
 iw_events.1000.a: "Diplomacy always prevails."
 iw_events.1000.b: "Let us go ahead with this coup."

 iw_events.1001.t: "Pressure in [florence_nation.GetName]"
 iw_events.1001.d: "The [From.Culture.GetAdjective] ruler has approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] with an offer. Wishing to help us from our many rivals in Italy, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] offers us protection should we join [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] league, supporting [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] conquest of the region. However, our advisors say to us that any aid would take years to arrive, leaving us isolated, and perhaps conquered should we not be careful about how we approach this."
 iw_events.1001.a: "A deal with the devil, but it is necessary..."
 iw_events.1001.b: "We shall remain free!"

 iw_events.1100.t: "A Crown for [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 iw_events.1100.d: "Despite [Root.Monarch.GetName] being elected as Emperor of the Romans, he has not been crowned by the Pope. Such phenomenon is not unheard of, but it still something that hurts [Root.Monarch.GerHerHis] legitimacy. For that reason it is expected for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to travel in Rome and be crowned there. However, with the many disputes in Italy, such journey would be dangerous, and has the possibility to be rejected, especially with the political turmoil between Emperor and Pope. For that reason, some suggest that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is crowned in [Root.Capital.GetName] by a local bishop."
 iw_events.1100.a: "We shall not take the journey, and instead crown ourselves here."
 iw_events.1100.b: "Let us journey to Rome."

 iw_events.1101.t: "A Crown for [From.Monarch.GetName]"
 iw_events.1101.d: "With the election of [From.Monarch.GetName], [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] has arrived in Rome, wishing to be crowned by [Root.Monarch.GetName]. That is normal for any Emperor to do, but within the turmoil in Italy, there runs the risk of angering many city states that oppose the Emperor."
 iw_events.1101.a: "[From.Monarch.GetSheHe] shall be crowned."
 iw_events.1101.b: "[From.Monarch.GetSheHe] was elected through corrupt methods."

 iw_events.1200.t: "The League of Cambrai"
 iw_events.1200.d: "Our rivals in [VEN.GetName] have grown out of control. Their league stands in opposition of our interests, as well as many others. Perhaps, through smart diplomacy, we can try to convince others to support us in curtailing these cunning merchants."
 iw_events.1200.a: "We shall summon the leaders to join us in this league of legends."
 iw_events.1200.b: "There is no need to form a league here, we shall fight them on our own!"

 iw_events.1201.t: "The League of Cambrai"
 iw_events.1201.d: "[From.GetName] has called forth upon other league leaders and rivals of [VEN.GetName]. He wants [Root.Monarch.GetName] to join [From.Monarch.GetHerHim] in the quest to utterly crush the [VEN.Culture.GetAdjective] dogs with all the might of Europe behind [From.Monarch.GetHerHim]. Shall we join them in this quest, or shall we sit idly by and wait for an opportunity ourselves?"
 iw_events.1201.a: "I would trade the world to crush the [VEN.Culture.GetAdjective] scums."
 iw_events.1201.b: "This league is not of our interest."
