 #Events:
 iw_interaction_events.1.t: "Expanding Our Sphere of Influence"
 iw_interaction_events.1.d: "With the orders of [ROOT.Monarch.GetName], the court of [ROOT.GetName] has been searching of new ways to spread its influence towards the province of [selected_province.GetName]. Some suggest that we simply buy land there, or even send capable men in order to influence the politics there. Our generals suggest that we send [target_country.GetName] some military aid, hoping to sway [target_country.Monarch.GetName] and gain the influence we want. There are some though that suggest other approaches. They would require us causing ruckus in the city, showing that their current overlords are not as capable as we, and then profiting as much as we can from the discord."

Fortunately for us, we can use this discord of these estates to gain some influence in [selected_province.GetName] to further our goals in the Italian Wars."
 iw_interaction_events.2.a: "Let us use the nobles."
