  IW_flavor.7.d: "The King of Naples has at last fled the country as he realizes that his situation is untenable. As such, the forces of us and [IW_iberian_league_leader.GetName] have finally obtained supremacy. With this, we are now made to owe up to our deal that was made before we began this campaign in the first place, one that has so far been of utmost secrecy beyond a few select delegates between our court and theirs.\n\n[IW_iberian_league_leader.GetName] will acknowledge our rightful claim to the Kingdom of Naples through the lineage of Rene the Good, but will recieve many lands in the south to make up for their illegtimate claim to the throne of the south, and to make up for their contributions to the war effort.\n\nWhilst much of the treaty was precise on what lands would be transferred to whom, a few lands inbetween them, having once been part of the provinces in which we ceded lands to [IW_iberian_league_leader.GetName], have become disputed. We will have to see how this dispute goes forward, but for now, Naples has finally been reclaimed by the heirs to the holdings of Anjou!"

  IW_flavor.13.d: "Despite us not being directly involved in the politics of Italy, one of the league leaders that would benefit us, [IW_french_league_leader.GetName], has accumilated a large amount of enemies. Right now they stand alone, possibly encircled by jealous rivals that would want to see them dismantled. We can try to aid them either economically, or send some of our bravest troops and generals to lead them on, as men within the [ROOT.GetName] have accomplished victory after victory. However, this conflict is still not of our concern, and some suggest that we do not get involved at all."

  IW_flavor.14.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has had a particular interest in [florence_nation.GetName] recently. Wishing to sway them within [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can choose two approaches. One of them is through diplomacy, as it is certain that the [florence_nation.Monarch.GetTitle] has not been in the best relations with the Pope and other Italian leagues. However, that runs at the risk of not having any way of aiding them in case their rivals decide to stop them. For that, many of our generals suggest a more violent yet effective approach, launching a coup within [florence_nation.Capital.GetName], forcing them on our side."
  IW_flavor.14.a: "Diplomacy always prevails."

  IW_flavor.15.d: "The [From.Culture.GetAdjective] ruler has approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] with an offer. Wishing to help us from our many rivals in Italy, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] offers us protection should we join [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] league, supporting [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] conquest of the region. However, our advisors say to us that any aid would take years to arrive, leaving us isolated, and perhaps conquered should we not be careful about how we approach this."

  IW_flavor.16.d: "Despite [Root.Monarch.GetName] being elected as Emperor of the Romans, he has not been crowned by the Pope. Such phenomenon is not unheard of, but it still something that hurts [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] legitimacy. For that reason it is expected for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to travel in Rome and be crowned there. However, with the many disputes in Italy, such journey would be dangerous, and has the possibility to be rejected, especially with the political turmoil between Emperor and Pope. For that reason, some suggest that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is crowned in [Root.Capital.GetName] by a local bishop."
  IW_flavor.16.a: "We shall not take the journey, and instead crown ourselves here."
